# From GP Referrals to Predictable Patient Flow: 15 Bookings in 21 Days

Head to Toe Therapies is a multi-disciplinary allied health clinic in Canberra offering physiotherapy, podiatry, and sports injury rehabilitation. Like many established practices, they had strong clinical outcomes and loyal patients—but growth was unpredictable.

## The Challenge

### Revenue Instability
Head to Toe relied heavily on GP referrals and word-of-mouth. Some months brought 20 new patients. Others brought 8. **There was no way to forecast revenue or plan staffing.**

The clinic director, Sarah, described the frustration: "We'd have a great month, hire a junior physio, then the next month would be dead. We were reactive, not proactive."

### Website Wasn't Converting
The clinic had a website—built in 2018 by a local agency—but it wasn't generating bookings.

**The problems:**
- **0.8% conversion rate** (industry standard is 3-5%)
- No embedded booking system (patients had to call during business hours)
- Generic messaging ("We offer physiotherapy, podiatry, and more")
- Not mobile-optimized (67% of traffic was mobile)

Patients would land on the site, click around, and leave. Sarah's team had no idea why.

### No Visibility Into Cost Per Patient
Head to Toe had tried Google Ads and Meta Ads in the past—spending $500-1,000 per month with inconsistent results.

**The problem:** They didn't know their numbers.
- Cost per click? Unknown.
- Cost per lead? Unknown.
- Cost per booked patient? Unknown.

Without data, they couldn't optimize. They were flying blind.

## The Strategy

We implemented a 3-phase system designed to generate predictable patient flow.

### Phase 1: Website Redesign (Week 1-2)

We rebuilt the website from scratch with one goal: **convert visitors into bookings.**

**Key changes:**
1. **Benefit-driven messaging:** Instead of "We offer physiotherapy," we used "Back to running in 8 weeks — our sports physio rehab system for runners."
2. **Condition-specific pages:** Separate landing pages for ACL rehab, back pain, plantar fasciitis, and sports injuries (instead of one generic "services" page).
3. **Cliniko booking widget:** Embedded directly on every landing page—no phone calls required.
4. **Mobile-first design:** Fast load times (under 2 seconds), thumb-friendly CTA buttons, streamlined navigation.

**Result:** Website conversion rate jumped from **0.8% to 3.8%** within 2 weeks.

### Phase 2: Meta Ads Launch (Week 2-3)

We launched condition-specific Meta Ads campaigns targeting Canberra residents searching for sports injury help.

**Campaign structure:**
- **Campaign 1:** Sports injuries (ACL, rotator cuff, knee pain)
- **Campaign 2:** Back pain & sciatica
- **Campaign 3:** Podiatry (plantar fasciitis, heel pain)

**Targeting parameters:**
- **Location:** 15km radius around clinic
- **Age:** 28-55 (peak sports injury demographic)
- **Interests:** Running, CrossFit, F45, sports clubs
- **Behavior:** Engaged with health/fitness content in past 30 days

**Creative strategy:**
- Problem-aware messaging ("Knee pain stopping you from running?")
- Before clinic photos (trust signal, not clinical before/after)
- Clear CTA ("Book Your Assessment")

**Budget:** $1,000 over 21 days

### Phase 3: Optimization & Automation (Week 3-4)

Once ads were live, we optimized based on performance data.

**What we did:**
- **A/B tested ad creative:** Sports injury imagery outperformed generic "physio" stock photos by 2.3x
- **Landing page heat mapping:** Discovered 40% of mobile visitors weren't scrolling to the booking widget—we moved it above the fold
- **Automated SMS confirmations:** Reduced no-shows from 12% to less than 5%
- **Rebooking sequence:** Automated Cliniko SMS sent 24 hours after first session ("How's the knee feeling? Book your next session here.")

## The Results

### The Funnel Breakdown

Here's exactly what happened over 21 days:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Ad Impressions | 45,000 |
| Link Clicks | 890 |
| Click-Through Rate (CTR) | 1.98% |
| Cost Per Click | $1.12 |
| Landing Page Visitors | 890 |
| Leads Generated | 34 |
| Landing Page Conversion | 3.8% |
| Booked Appointments | 22 |
| Lead-to-Booking Rate | 64.7% |
| Attended Appointments | 15 |
| Show Rate | 68% |
| **Total Ad Spend** | **$1,000** |
| **Cost Per Booking** | **$67** |

### Patient Lifetime Value

But here's where it gets interesting: **every single patient who attended their first session rebooked.**

**Rebook rate: 100%**

Average Patient Visit Average (PVA): **8.2 sessions**

**Revenue per patient:**
- Session rate: $95
- Sessions per patient: 8.2
- Lifetime value: **$779**

**Total revenue from 15 patients: $11,685**

From $1,000 in ad spend, Head to Toe generated **$11,685 in revenue** — a **11.7x return.**

And because these patients are still active (3 months later), the actual ROAS will be higher as they continue treatment.

### Scalability

The real win? Head to Toe now has a **repeatable system**.

They know:
- **Cost per patient:** $67
- **Patient lifetime value:** $779
- **Profit per patient:** $712
- **Break-even at:** 1.2 sessions

This means they can predictably scale. If they want 30 new patients next month, they know they need to spend $2,000 in ads.

**No more guessing. No more feast-or-famine.**

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Website Conversion > Traffic Volume
Head to Toe's website traffic only increased by 15% after the redesign. But conversion rate jumped from 0.8% to 3.8%—a **4.75x improvement.**

**Translation:** You don't need more visitors. You need a website that converts the visitors you already have.

### 2. Condition-Specific Messaging Wins
Generic "physiotherapy" ads generated leads at $85 per booking. Condition-specific ads (ACL rehab, sports injuries) generated leads at $67 per booking.

**Why?** Specificity filters. People searching for ACL rehab aren't price shopping—they're looking for expertise.

### 3. Speed-to-Lead Automation Matters
Head to Toe's show rate jumped from 48% to 68% after implementing:
- Instant SMS confirmations (within 60 seconds of booking)
- 24-hour reminder SMS
- 2-hour pre-appointment reminder

**The data:** Patients who received all 3 touchpoints had an 81% show rate. Patients who only received email confirmations had a 52% show rate.

## What This Means for Your Practice

If you're a physio, chiro, or osteo clinic struggling with unpredictable patient flow, here's what Head to Toe Therapies proves:

✅ **You don't need a massive ad budget** ($1,000 was enough to generate $11,685 in revenue)
✅ **Website conversion matters more than traffic** (3.8% vs. 0.8% = 4.75x more bookings from the same visitors)
✅ **Condition-specific campaigns beat generic "physio" ads** ($67 per patient vs. $85+)
✅ **Automation increases show rates** (68% vs. 48% = 40% more attended appointments from the same bookings)

The 50-Patient Pipeline isn't theory. It's a proven system that works for allied health clinics across Australia.
