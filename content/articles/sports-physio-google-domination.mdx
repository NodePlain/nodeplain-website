You're busy. 30 patients a week. Your junior physios need more volume. But here's the problem: you're burning $2,000 a month on Google Ads and getting price shoppers asking if you bulk bill.

Sound familiar?

Most sports physio clinics make the same mistake: they target the keyword "physiotherapy" and wonder why their cost-per-click (CPC) is $8.00 and their conversion rate is abysmal.

The truth? **Generic "physio" keywords attract price-conscious patients, not private-pay sports injury cases.**

This guide shows you the exact system that Head to Toe Therapies used to acquire 15 new private patients for $1,000 in ad spend — at just $67 per patient. No fluff. Just the playbook.

## Why Generic "Physio" Ads Fail

Let's start with what doesn't work.

When you run Google Ads targeting broad keywords like "physiotherapist near me" or "back pain physio," you're competing with:
- Bulk billing clinics with $50,000/month ad budgets
- Corporate chains offering $50 initial consultations
- EPC providers fishing for Medicare revenue

**The result?** You're paying $8-12 per click to attract patients who:
1. Book an initial assessment
2. Don't rebook after session 1
3. Ask if you're "in network" with their private health fund

Your Patient Visit Average (PVA) stays stuck at 3.2. Your junior physios sit at 60% capacity. And you're left wondering if digital marketing even works.

**It does. But not like this.**

## The Condition-Specific Approach

Here's what works: **Stop selling "physiotherapy" and start selling solutions to specific problems.**

Instead of targeting:
- "Sports physio [suburb]"
- "Physiotherapy near me"
- "Best physio [city]"

Target:
- "ACL rehab [suburb]"
- "Rotator cuff physio near me"
- "Post-op knee physio [city]"
- "Plantar fasciitis treatment [suburb]"

### Why This Works

When someone searches "ACL rehab," they're not price shopping. They're 8 weeks post-surgery, they've been referred by their orthopaedic surgeon, and they need a physio who understands periodization and return-to-sport protocols.

**They're not calling to ask if you bulk bill. They're calling to ask if you have availability.**

This is the difference between:
- $8 CPC → $3.50 CPC
- 1.2% conversion rate → 4.8% conversion rate
- $450 cost per patient → $67 cost per patient

## The Google Ads Strategy

Here's the step-by-step system for condition-specific campaigns.

### Step 1: Build Separate Campaigns for Each Condition

Don't lump all sports injuries into one campaign. Create individual campaigns for:
- **ACL / Knee Injuries** (ACL rehab, meniscus tear, patellofemoral pain)
- **Shoulder / Rotator Cuff** (rotator cuff rehab, shoulder impingement, post-op shoulder)
- **Back & Spine** (disc bulge, sciatica, chronic back pain)
- **Running Injuries** (shin splints, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonopathy)

**Why separate campaigns?**
1. Different search intent = different ad copy
2. Easier budget allocation (spend more on your highest-converting conditions)
3. Better Quality Score = lower CPC

### Step 2: Use Long-Tail Keywords

Long-tail keywords are your secret weapon.

Instead of bidding on "physio [suburb]" (high competition, high CPC), bid on:
- "ACL rehab physio [suburb]"
- "Post-op rotator cuff physiotherapy near me"
- "Running physio for shin splints [suburb]"

**The data:**
- "Physio Canberra" → $9.20 CPC
- "ACL rehab physio Canberra" → $3.80 CPC

Long-tail keywords have:
- Lower competition
- Higher intent
- Better conversion rates

### Step 3: Location Targeting (But Do It Right)

You don't need to dominate the entire city. You need to dominate your **15km radius**.

Set your location targeting to:
- **Primary radius:** 10km (your core catchment)
- **Secondary radius:** 15km (willing to travel for specialized care)

**Don't** waste budget targeting the entire metro area. A patient in the northern suburbs isn't driving 45 minutes for physio—no matter how good your ad is.

### Step 4: Negative Keywords (The CPC Saver)

Add these negative keywords to every campaign:
- Bulk billing
- Free
- Cheap
- Students
- Massage (unless you offer it)

Why? Because you don't want to pay $6 per click for someone searching "bulk billing sports physio" when you charge $95 per session.

**Negative keywords can cut wasted spend by 30-40%.**

### Step 5: Ad Copy That Converts

Your ad copy should speak directly to the condition.

**Bad ad copy:**
> "Sports Physio in [Suburb] | Expert Care | Book Online"

**Good ad copy:**
> "ACL Rehab Specialist | RTS Protocols | Book Your Assessment | [Suburb]"

Notice the difference?
- Specificity (ACL, not generic "sports")
- Credibility signal (RTS = return to sport)
- Clear CTA (assessment, not vague "care")

Use the headline to filter. If someone isn't looking for ACL rehab, they won't click. **That's a good thing.** You only pay when qualified leads click.

## Landing Page Optimization

Your ad is only half the equation. If your landing page converts at 1%, you're hemorrhaging money.

### Problem-Aware Messaging

Your landing page should mirror the search intent.

If someone searched "rotator cuff physio," your headline should be:
> **Rotator Cuff Rehab That Gets You Back to Training**

Not:
> "Welcome to [Clinic Name] Physiotherapy"

**The structure:**
1. **Headline:** Condition + outcome
2. **Subheadline:** Credibility signal (e.g., "15+ years treating overhead athletes")
3. **Pain point validation:** "Tried cortisone? Still can't lift overhead without pain?"
4. **Solution framework:** 3-phase rehab process (assessment, rehab, return-to-sport)
5. **Social proof:** "Treated 200+ rotator cuff cases in 2024"
6. **CTA:** "Book Your Assessment" (not "Contact Us")

### Mobile-First Design

63% of physio searches happen on mobile. If your landing page isn't mobile-optimized, you're losing half your traffic.

**Checklist:**
- ✅ CTA button above the fold
- ✅ Click-to-call phone number (not a contact form)
- ✅ Fast load time (<2 seconds)
- ✅ Simple booking flow (Cliniko widget, not a 7-field form)

### Cliniko Integration

If you're using Cliniko (or Halaxy/Nookal), embed your online booking widget directly on the landing page.

**Why?**
- Eliminates "phone tag" (patient calls, you're with a client, they book elsewhere)
- Captures after-hours bookings (30% of bookings happen between 6pm-10pm)
- Reduces admin load on your front desk

## The Rebooking System

Acquiring a patient for $67 is great. But if they only come for 1 session, you've lost money.

Here's how to turn new patients into long-term cases.

### Automated Follow-Ups

Use Cliniko's SMS automation to send:
- **24-hour post-session:** "How's the shoulder feeling? Any questions before your next session?"
- **Pre-appointment reminder:** "Your ACL rehab session is tomorrow at 3pm. See you then!"
- **Post-discharge:** "It's been 3 months since your last visit. Ready for a maintenance session?"

**The data:** Automated SMS reminders reduce DNAs (Did Not Attend) by 40% and increase rebooking rates by 25%.

### PVA Optimization

Your Patient Visit Average (PVA) is the #1 metric that determines profitability.

If your PVA is:
- **3 visits:** Break-even (patient acquisition cost = session revenue)
- **6 visits:** Profitable
- **10+ visits:** Highly profitable

**How to increase PVA:**
1. Set expectations at initial assessment ("ACL rehab is typically 12-16 weeks")
2. Use a phased treatment plan (Assessment → Rehab → Return to Sport)
3. Pre-book the next 4 sessions at the end of each visit
4. Offer package pricing (e.g., 10-session package at 10% discount)

## Case Study: Head to Toe Therapies

Let's look at real numbers.

**The Setup:**
- Multi-disciplinary clinic in Canberra
- Offering: Sports physio, podiatry
- Goal: Fill junior physio columns with private patients

**The Campaign:**
- Ad spend: $1,000
- Duration: 21 days
- Targeting: ACL rehab, sports injuries, post-op physio (15km radius)

**The Results:**
- Impressions: 45,000
- Clicks: 890 (1.98% CTR)
- Cost per click: $1.12
- Leads: 34 (3.8% landing page conversion)
- Bookings: 15 (44% lead-to-booking rate)
- **Cost per patient: $67**

3. **Mobile-optimized landing pages** (with embedded booking)
4. **Automated rebooking systems** (to maximize PVA)

Head to Toe Therapies proved it: **$1,000 → 15 patients → $18,000 in revenue.**

Your junior physios don't need to sit at 60% capacity. Your clinic doesn't need to rely on GP referrals. And you don't need to burn $8+ per click on price shoppers.

You just need the right system.
