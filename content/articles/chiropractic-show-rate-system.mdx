You generate 50 leads a month. But here's the problem: **25 of them never answer the phone.**

The ones who do answer? Half of them ghost before the appointment.

You're left with maybe 15-20 attended appointments from 50 leads. That's a **30-40% show rate**—and it's killing your ROI.

Here's the reality: lead quality isn't your problem. **Speed-to-lead is.**

This guide breaks down the exact automation system that gets chiropractors to a guaranteed 70%+ show rate—without hiring more staff or spending 3 hours a day on follow-up calls.

## The Ghosting Problem

Let's quantify the damage.

**Scenario: You generate 50 leads per month**
- Cost per lead: $40
- Total ad spend: $2,000

**Current flow (30% show rate):**
- 50 leads generated
- 15 attended appointments
- Cost per attended appointment: $133
- Conversion rate to care plan: 60%
- New care plans: 9
- **Cost per new patient: $222**

**With 70% show rate:**
- 50 leads generated
- 35 attended appointments
- Cost per attended appointment: $57
- Conversion rate to care plan: 60%
- New care plans: 21
- **Cost per new patient: $95**

**That's a 57% reduction in cost per patient—from the same ad budget.**

The difference isn't lead quality. It's **speed and follow-up.**

## Why Speed-to-Lead Matters

Here's the data that will change how you think about lead response time.

**Harvard Business Review study (2011):**
- Contact a lead within **1 minute**: 391% higher conversion
- Contact a lead within **5 minutes**: Still good
- Contact a lead after **10 minutes**: Conversion drops 400%

**Translation for chiropractors:**
- If you call within 60 seconds: **70-80% answer rate**
- If you call within 5 minutes: **50-60% answer rate**
- If you call after 30 minutes: **20-30% answer rate**

Why? Because patients are searching for help **right now**. They've just filled out your form while sitting in pain at their desk, or lying in bed with sciatica.

If you don't call them within 5 minutes, they've already:
1. Filled out 2 more forms
2. Called another clinic
3. Booked with whoever answered first

**Speed isn't a nice-to-have. It's a conversion multiplier.**

## The Speed-to-Lead Automation Stack

You can't sit by your phone 24/7 waiting for leads to come in. And your front desk can't drop everything to make outbound calls.

**You need automation.**

Here's the exact stack that gets 70%+ show rates.

### Layer 1: Instant SMS (0-30 seconds)

The moment someone fills out your lead form, they should receive an SMS.

**Example SMS template:**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Clinic]. We got your request for help with [condition]. We're reviewing your case now and will call you in the next 2 minutes. If you need urgent help, call us at [number]."

**Why this works:**
1. Confirms they submitted the form correctly
2. Sets expectation for the phone call
3. Provides a fallback if they can't answer

**Tech setup:** Most form builders (Typeform, Jotform, GHL) integrate with SMS platforms (Twilio, ClickSend).

Cost: ~$0.10 per SMS.

### Layer 2: Immediate Phone Call (1-3 minutes)

Within 1-3 minutes of form submission, your front desk should call the lead.

**But what if it's after hours?**

This is where automation saves you. Use a system like:
- **GoHighLevel** (all-in-one CRM with auto-dialer)
- **CallRail** (tracks calls, auto-dials from queue)
- **Cliniko + Zapier** (triggers call task)

**The script:**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Clinic]. You just filled out a form about [condition]—did I catch you at a good time?"

Keep it conversational. You're not selling yet. You're qualifying.

### Layer 3: Follow-Up Sequence (If No Answer)

If they don't answer the first call, most clinics give up. **Big mistake.**

Your sequence should be:
1. **Call #1** (1-3 minutes after form): No answer
2. **SMS #1** (5 minutes after form): "Tried calling—are you still looking for help with [condition]? Reply YES and I'll call back."
3. **Call #2** (30 minutes after form): Leave voicemail
4. **Email #1** (1 hour after form): "We tried reaching you" + booking link
5. **Call #3** (Day 2, 10am): Final attempt
6. **SMS #2** (Day 3): "Last check-in" + booking link

**Result:** You go from 1 touchpoint to 6 touchpoints—without manual work.

**The data:** 80% of leads convert between touchpoints 5-8. Most clinics quit after touchpoint 2.

### Layer 4: Confirmation Sequence (Post-Booking)

They've booked. Great. But **18% of patients no-show even after booking.**

Your confirmation sequence:
1. **SMS confirmation** (immediately after booking): "Confirmed! [Day] at [Time]. See you then."
2. **Email confirmation** (5 minutes after booking): Calendar invite + clinic details + parking info
3. **Reminder #1** (48 hours before): "Your appointment is in 2 days. Reply CONFIRM to keep your spot."
4. **Reminder #2** (2 hours before): "Your appointment with Dr. [Name] is at [Time] today. We're at [address]."

**Why this works:** No-shows drop from 18% to <5%.

**Bonus:** The "Reply CONFIRM" technique increases commitment (they actively confirm, not just passively receive).

## AHPRA-Compliant Marketing

Speed-to-lead systems are powerful. But if your ads get banned, none of it matters.

Here's how to market chiropractic **without** violating AHPRA advertising regulations.

### What You CAN'T Do

According to AHPRA Guidelines Section 133 (advertising regulated health services):
- ❌ Before/after X-rays or photos
- ❌ Testimonials claiming clinical outcomes ("cured my back pain")
- ❌ Guarantees of therapeutic effectiveness ("guaranteed relief")
- ❌ Comparisons to other practitioners ("better than physios")

**If you're using before/after X-rays in Meta Ads, you're one complaint away from a $10,000 fine + ad account ban.**

### What You CAN Do

✅ **Educational content:** "What is spinal decompression?"
✅ **Condition targeting:** "Struggling with sciatica? Here's what we do."
✅ **Process explanation:** "Our 3-phase approach to disc bulges"
✅ **Authority signals:** "15 years experience with sports injuries"
✅ **Testimonials about service** (not outcomes): "Best customer service" or "Easy to book"

**The key:** Focus on **education** and **process**, not **outcome promises**.

### Example: AHPRA-Safe Ad Copy

**Non-compliant:**
> "Eliminate back pain in 30 days. Guaranteed results. See our before/after X-rays."

**Compliant:**
> "Chronic disc bulge? Learn how our 3-phase spinal decompression protocol works. Book your consultation to see if you're a candidate."

Notice the difference:
- No outcome guarantee
- Educational framing ("learn how")
- Qualification language ("see if you're a candidate")

**This ad won't get banned. And it still converts.**

## Targeting High-Value Cases

Not all leads are created equal.

A patient with acute wry neck might come for 2-3 sessions and disappear. A patient with chronic disc bulge + sciatica might sign up for a 24-session care plan worth $3,000.

**You want more of the latter.**

### High-Value Conditions to Target

Focus your ad spend on:
1. **Disc bulges / Sciatica:** Long treatment timeline, high pain = high intent
2. **Chronic headaches / Migraines:** Tried everything else, willing to invest
3. **Sports injuries (non-acute):** Athletes are motivated + have disposable income
4. **Postural issues:** Office workers, chronic problem, care plan candidates

### Avoid Low-Value Conditions

De-prioritize:
- Acute wry neck (1-3 visits max)
- Generic "back pain" (too broad, price shoppers)
- Work-injury claims (insurance hassles, slow payment)

**Why?** Your ad spend should target **care plan candidates**, not one-session patients.

### Ad Targeting Strategy

Use Facebook/Instagram interest targeting:
- CrossFit, F45, running clubs (athletes with recurring injuries)
- "Chronic pain support" groups (long-term conditions)
- Age 35-55 (peak earning years, willing to pay out-of-pocket)

**Exclude:** Age 18-24 (low income), "bulk billing" interest

**Location:** 20km radius max (people won't drive 45 minutes for chiro)

## No-Show Prevention Tactics

You've booked the appointment. Now you need to make sure they show up.

### Tactic 1: The Commitment Deposit

Require a $50 deposit at booking (refundable if they show, forfeited if they no-show).

**Why this works:** Financial commitment = 3x higher show rate.

**The objection:** "Won't this hurt conversion?"

**The data:** Yes, 15% of leads won't book with a deposit requirement. But those 15% were going to no-show anyway. You're filtering out time-wasters.

### Tactic 2: Calendar Blocking

Don't let patients book more than 5 days out for initial consultations.

**Why?** The longer the wait, the higher the no-show rate.
- 1-2 days out: 5% no-show
- 3-5 days out: 10% no-show
- 7+ days out: 25% no-show

**Solution:** Offer next-day or same-day appointments. If you're booked solid, add "waitlist priority" for cancellations.

### Tactic 3: The Confirmation Call

Have your front desk call 24 hours before the appointment.

**Script:**
> "Hi [Name], just confirming your appointment with Dr. [Name] tomorrow at [Time]. Do you know where we're located?"

**Why this works:** It's a soft commitment check. If they're flaky, they'll cancel now (better than wasting your time tomorrow).

**Bonus:** Use this call to pre-qualify for care plan fit.

## Care Plan Conversion

Show rate is step one. **Care plan conversion is step two.**

Getting someone to show up for a $95 consultation is easy. Getting them to commit to a $3,000 care plan? That's where the money is.

### The Report of Findings (ROF) Framework

Your ROF is your sales moment. Here's the structure that converts.

**Phase 1: Validation (5 minutes)**
- Acknowledge their pain journey ("You've tried everything—PT, cortisone, chiropractors who just 'crack and pop'")
- Empathy first, diagnosis second

**Phase 2: Education (10 minutes)**
- X-ray findings (if applicable)
- Explain the root cause (subluxation, disc degeneration, curve loss—whatever your model)
- **Key:** Use visuals (spine model, X-rays, diagrams)

**Phase 3: The Plan (10 minutes)**
- "Here's what we recommend: Phase 1 is correction (12 weeks, 3x/week). Phase 2 is stabilization (8 weeks, 2x/week). Phase 3 is maintenance (1x/month)."
- Break it down by phase, not total cost

**Phase 4: Investment (5 minutes)**
- "The investment for Phase 1 is $2,800. That includes X-rays, all adjustments, and progress scans."
- Offer payment plan ("or $240/week for 12 weeks")
- **Don't** apologize for the price. You're solving a 10-year problem.

**Conversion benchmark:** 60-70% of ROF appointments should convert to care plan.

### Ongoing: Optimization
- [ ] Monitor show rate weekly (target: 70%+)
- [ ] A/B test SMS templates (test 2 variants per month)
- [ ] Track care plan conversion rate (target: 60%+)
- [ ] Adjust follow-up sequence based on response data

## The Bottom Line

Show rates aren't luck. They're systems.

You don't need "better" leads. You need:
1. **Instant response** (SMS within 30 seconds, call within 3 minutes)
2. **Persistent follow-up** (6 touchpoints minimum)
3. **AHPRA-safe marketing** (education, not outcome promises)
4. **High-value targeting** (disc bulge > wry neck)
5. **No-show prevention** (deposits, confirmations, short booking windows)

**The result:** 70%+ show rate. 60%+ care plan conversion. And a practice that runs on systems, not hope.
