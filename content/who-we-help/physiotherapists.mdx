## Why Physio Clinics Choose NodePlain

Most marketing agencies treat physiotherapists like gyms or spas. they focus on "discounts" and "offers".

We know that a physiotherapy patient is looking for trust, expertise, and a solution to their pain. Our campaigns reflect that.

### Our Strategy for Physios

1.  **Condition-Specific Landing Pages**: We build pages for "Back Pain", "Knee Rehab", "Sports Physio" so the patient feels understood immediately.
2.  **Authority-Building Content**: We help you produce content that positions your clinic as the local expert.
3.  **Retention Automation**: We set up automated email flows to reactivate past patients who haven't visited in 6 months.
